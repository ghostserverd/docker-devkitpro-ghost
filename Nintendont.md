# Background

My personal goal for my Wii U is to essentially turn it into a Gamecube. I want to play all of my old Gamecube games (which I still have) with a native HDMI output and newer controllers (Wii U Pro Controllers).

The requirements I set for myself for this project are:

1. Launch Gamecube games directly from the Wii U Home Menu (injected Nintendont autoboot).
2. Launch a game, play it, quit the game with the Wii U Pro Controller (without picking up the Gamepad or a Wiimote).
3. Be able to use the Wii U Gamepad as a controller if necessary (to support additional players).

Some games (e.g. Super Smash Bros Melee) don't really care which slot a controller is in, but for other games (e.g. Mario Kart Double Dash) the first controller is the only one that can navigate the menu.

This means that in order to accomplish requirement 2, I need to be able to be able to configure `Nintendont` to assign a Wii U Pro Controller as controller slot 1.

After setting up tiramisu and installing `Nintendont`, I discovered 2 things:

1. There is a setting in `Nintendont` to configure which controller slot the Wii U Gamepad occupies (ðŸ¥¹).
2. The setting does not work for games installed with an injector (ðŸ˜ž).

I beat my head against a wall trying a bunch of different things to get it to work (different builds of TeconMoon's injector, different injectors alltogether, different config files, different builds of `Nintendont`), but no matter what I tried, the Wii U Gamepad always took up controller slot 1.

I was almost resigned to just launching games directly from `Nintendont`, but I decided that I really wanted to accomplish all of my goals, so I set out to try to figure out how I could get this to work.

This is a chronicle of the things I learned as I took this journey, the fixes I implemented, and at the end, a call to action to hopefully get this fixed for the community once and for all.

First, some background about the `WiiUGamepadSlot` setting.

# WiiUGamepadSlot

In 2018, a [request](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont/issues/620) was made in the `Nintendont` repo to allow disabling the Wii U Gamepad or choosing its controller slot. Eventually someone made a [fork](https://github.com/NazarSurm/Nintendont---No-gamepad-on-Player-1#) of `Nintendont` with a [change](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont/commit/3decbfaeed21e21f28259e015c95a77f6116a8d0) to disable the gamepad entirely.

> ðŸ““ This actually helps get me pretty dang close to my goals, except for the 3rd one. And I almost just stopped here with the intention of buying more Pro Controllers so I wouldn't have to use the Gamepad at all.

3 years later, a [PR](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont/pull/887) was opened to allow choosing the controller slot for the Wii U Gamepad. This added a new configuration for `Nintendont` called `WiiUGamepadSlot` in the `nincfg.bin` format.

After that change was made, it was determined that it had introduced a bug where the Wii U Gamepad was disabled when `Nintendont` was in `autoboot` mode. A [workaround](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont/commit/fd5e85c4fe4c4015936e21b16242fa0f15449e99) was put into place to always make the `WiiUGamepadSlot` be 0 if it was detected that `Nintendont` was running in `autoboot` mode.

```
if (((NIN_CFG*)0x93004000)->Config & NIN_CFG_AUTO_BOOT)
{
  if(HIDPad == HID_PAD_NONE)
    WiiUGamepadSlot = 0;
  else
    WiiUGamepadSlot = 1;
}
```

> ðŸ““ This means that when in `autoboot` mode, `WiiUGamepadSlot` will never work! This is the first real clue for what kinds of things might be treated differently in `autoboot` vs `normal` mode.

Let's look at how `Nintendont` configuration works next. Maybe that will provide some additional insight.

# Nintendont configuration

## nincfg.bin

`Nintendont` requires a `nincfg.bin` file in the root of your SD card to define the `Nintendont` configuration.

From what I can tell, the `nincfg.bin` file format is simply a binary representation of the `NIN_CFG` struct defined in `Nintendont` in [`common/include/CommonConfig.h`](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont/blob/master/common/include/CommonConfig.h#L12).

When you launch `Nintendont` and change some setting, it updates the `nincfg.bin` with your changed configuration. There is also a tool called [Nicoe](https://github.com/libertyernie/Nicoe) which can read and modify a `nincfg.bin` file from a Windows PC (and without having to launch `Nintendont` on a Wii U).

## Initializing NIN_CFG

In `normal` mode (i.e. not `autoboot` / injected mode, i.e. launching a game from the `Nintendont` menu) `Nintendont` [loads](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont/blob/fd5e85c4fe4c4015936e21b16242fa0f15449e99/loader/source/global.c#L333) `sizeof(NIN_CFG)` bytes of the file `nincfg.bin` into a memory block that is the same size as the `NIN_CFG` struct.

In `autoboot` mode, whatever is initializing `Nintendont` (the forwarder) passes the `NIN_CFG` bytes as an argument, and `Nintendont` [copies](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont/blob/d64d0da20d5db8326539c07f5898b8601131095c/loader/source/main.c#L573) those bytes into a memory block that is the same size as the `NIN_CFG` struct.

> ðŸ““ This is another critical difference in functionality that hints at why `WiiUGamepadSlot` works in `normal` mode but not `autoboot` mode.

## Versioning and backwards compatibility

`Nintendont` makes some provisions to sanitize config files that may not be fully up-to-date with the latest version of the config format. The `NIN_CFG` struct contains a `Version` [member](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont/blob/c0e97a5efba3c3d184d7c20d6036916b2877703b/common/include/CommonConfig.h#L15), and when `Nintendont` detects that the version of the config that was loaded is [older than the current version](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont/blob/fd5e85c4fe4c4015936e21b16242fa0f15449e99/loader/source/global.c#L417), it sets some defaults for members that did not exist in previous versions and updates the `Version` to the latest.

The important thing to note for our purposes is this:

```
  if (ncfg->Version == 9) {
    ncfg->WiiUGamepadSlot = 0;
    ncfg->Version = 10;
  }
```

If the `Version` in the `NIN_CFG` struct is `9`, `WiiUGamepadSlot` gets initialized to 0.

But the [current version](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont/blob/c0e97a5efba3c3d184d7c20d6036916b2877703b/common/include/CommonConfig.h#L8) of `NIN_CFG` is `10` (`0xA` in hex) which means that bit of code never gets run. So the expectation is that if you have a `NIN_CFG` of version `10`, the `WiiUGamepadSlot` value is already defined, and it doesn't need to be initialized with some default value.

> ðŸ““ This points to a liklihood that `Nintendont` is being initialized with a `NIN_CFG` of version `10`, but no (valid) `WiiUGamepadSlot` is set.

Here's the `nincfg.bin` I'm using. It's version `10`, and `WiiUGamepadSlot` is 2 (this is 0-indexed so it's really the third controller slot).

!!! ADD IMAGE !!!

The `nincfg.bin` is fine. Remember, launching a game from `Nintendont` directly results in the `WiiUGamepadSlot` in controller slot 3 as expected.

So maybe there's something about the injection / autoboot process that's going wrong? How do those injectors work anyway?

# Autoboot forwarding

> ðŸ““ I'm going to focus on TeconMoon's Wii VC injector. There are other injectors (e.g. `UWUVCI` and I believe `Wii U USB Helper` has some injection capabilities), but I'm most familiar with TeconMoon's at the moment. Also TeconMoon's injector supports custom forwarders which is important for helping us fix the issue with `WiiUGamepadSlot` and `autoboot`.

There is a ton of detail I'm going to skip over related to Wii VC injection (mostly because I don't actually know all of the details), but for our purposes and at a very high level, an injector creates an installable file or files (likely WUP format) that you can install as a Title to your Wii U Home Menu (using e.g. WUP Installer) , which places an icon on your Wii U home page to launch some application (in our case it needs to launch the Wii VC with a GCN game and `Nintendont`).

We need _something_ to tell `Nintendont` to automatically launch a game instead of booting to the `Nintendont` menu. E.g.

```
a forwarder for Wii VC to autoboot an included game
```

Enter [`nintendont-autoboot-forwarder`](https://github.com/FIX94/nintendont-autoboot-forwarder).

Now I don't know all of the technical details, but from what I can gather, TeconMoon's injector uses this forwarder to build the injector. If you download the [TOOLDIR](https://github.com/piratesephiroth/TeconmoonWiiVCInjector/blob/main/TeconMoon's%20WiiVC%20Injector/Resources/TOOLDIR.zip) from the source and unzip it, you'll find compiled `dol` files from the [releases](https://github.com/FIX94/nintendont-autoboot-forwarder/releases/tag/v1.2) page of `nintendont-autoboot-forwarder`.

We want to know exactly what the forwarder is doing, so it is int

If we go look at the [`main.c`](https://github.com/FIX94/nintendont-autoboot-forwarder/blob/master/source/main.c) file, we can see a couple things

1. It [reads nincfg.bin from the sd card](https://github.com/FIX94/nintendont-autoboot-forwarder/blob/master/source/main.c#L77) (kind of like how [`Nintendont` does](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont/blob/master/loader/source/global.c#L328))
    ```
    f = fopen("sd:/nincfg.bin","rb");
    ```

2. It [loads the contents of the file into memory](https://github.com/FIX94/nintendont-autoboot-forwarder/blob/master/source/main.c#L85) (similar to how [`Nintendont` does](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont/blob/master/loader/source/global.c#L333))
    ```
    fread(&nincfg,1,sizeof(NIN_CFG),f);
    ```

3. And then after potentially making some changes to the config (e.g. disabling all widescreen bits), it [writes the config bytes back to some memory address](https://github.com/FIX94/nintendont-autoboot-forwarder/blob/master/source/main.c#L110) for `Nintendont` to eventually [read from](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont/blob/master/loader/source/main.c#L573).
    ```
    memcpy(CMD_ADDR+full_fPath_len, &nincfg, sizeof(NIN_CFG));
    ```

> ðŸ““ Notice how we're consistently using `sizeof(NIN_CFG)` to determine how many bytes to read in and out of memory. This is the crux of the problem.
